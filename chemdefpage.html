			<h1>What is Chemistry?</h1>
			<ul> <li>Chemistry is a study that observes the properties, 
			compositions, and structures of the building blocks of
			everything around us, which are called atoms. The air you
			breate, the food you eat, and the water you drink are all
			made of atoms.</li>
			<li>It also deals with the behavior of substances 
			(which are also composed of atoms) when they come into contact 
			with each other or a certain factor that can change their
			properties, like heat.</li>
			<li>Chemistry can even be seen in everyday 
			life. A good example is when you cook food, because of how 
			the composition of the food changes due to the heat of the stove. 
			</li> </ul>
			<h4>Chemistry can be divided into 5 major branches, namely:</h4>
